# Aims

As this is a limited workshop due to time constraints of remote working across multiple timezones we would like to focus on:

1. Meeting developers from other facilities
2. Sharing best practice and new developments
3. Tackling issues that frustrate developers in mantid

# Preparation

By way of introduction we would like each attendee to prepare a slide about themselves as so that we can get to know each other.
We will collate the slides into a single deck before the meeting to avoid having to switch screen shares constantly.
Please create a single page PDF with the following content:

 - A photo
 - Name
 - Facility affiliation
 - Expertise
 - Current work/projects

Once you have create the PDF please create a pull request into the [intro-slides directory](./intro-slides) in this repository.
