# Developer Workshop 2021

This document contains the agenda for the 2021 Mantid Developer Workshop.
Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic the meeting is organized as a remote workshop with everyone attending via Zoom.

Dates: 2nd/3rd December 2021
Times: 
  - Grenwich Mean Time (GMT): 13:30 - 16:30
  - Central European Time (CET): 14:30 - 17:30
  - Eastern Standard Time (EST): 08:30 - 11:30
  - China Stanadard Time (CST): 21:30 - 00:30
  - Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT): 00:30 - 03:30

## Aims

As this is a limited workshop due to time constraints of remote working across multiple timezones we would like to focus on:

1. Meeting developers from other facilities
2. Sharing best practice and new developments
3. Tackling issues that frustrate developers in mantid

## Preparation

By way of introduction we would like each attendee to prepare a slide about themselves as so that we can get to know each other.
We will collate the slides into a single deck before the meeting to avoid having to switch screen shares constantly.
Please create a single page PDF with the following content:

 - A photo
 - Name
 - Facility affiliation
 - Expertise
 - Current work/projects

Once you have created the PDF slide, please include your name in the file name, create a pull request into the [intro-slides directory](./intro-slides) into this repository.
This can all be done entirely on the GitHub interface as follows:

 - fork this repository by clicking "Fork" on the top right of this page and select your GitHub username
 - you will be redirected the forked copy automatically
 - click through the to the `technical-working-group/workshops/developer-workshop-2021-12/intro-slides` directory
 - click "Add file->Upload files"
 - drag the pdf into the square as shown on the page and click commit.
 - navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and create a new pull request into the base "mantidproject/governance" repository
