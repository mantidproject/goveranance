# Developer Workshop 2021

Date: TBC

We plan on organizing a developer meeting around the dates of the 2021
Mantid User Meeting (29-30th November 2021).
This document exists to assist with planning the meeting agenda
and other details.

## Theme

Initial discussions raised the issue that teams at facilties have changed quite
a bit and this could have become a barrier to more effective communication.

- A desirable outcome, if nothing else, will be improved relationships across
  the development teams.

## Ideas

- Each developer does a 1-2 min lightning talk introducing themselves to the team and giving
  a bit of their background. Create a slide template for people to fill in (All) ~60mins
- Group coding exercise (Gilded Rose, Coding dojo) ~60mins
- More-indepth updates of technical details: ~60mins
  - Conda intro/tutorial
  - Precommit/CI jobs
