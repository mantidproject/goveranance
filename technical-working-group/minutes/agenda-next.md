# Recap actions from previous meeting:

# Agenda
- General updates (Gigg)
  - 6.5: Currently out for beta testing. Not much feedback from ISIS yet. Any others?
  - Expected release date for 6.5: 17th October.
  - Any blockers?
- Can we move all pull requests to conda-based environments? This would mean we stop shipping .rpm/.deb
- Can we merge the conda-recipes to the main repository? Updating them at the same time as the code is painful at the moment.
