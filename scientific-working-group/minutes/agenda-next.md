# Next SWG Meeting (End of June 2021)

# Recap actions from previous meeting:

### ORNL, JCNS, PSI - Facilities without a roadmap
- Facilities that have not provided a roadmap are asked to circulate one before the next meeting.

### SWG members
- Read each others roadmaps and identify common areas.
- Consider how to turn commonalities in roadmaps into planned collaborative projects?

- Provide updated version of ANSTO roadmap in a few weeks.

### Daniel
- Send poll to organise the next meeting in a month!
- Upload all circulated roadmaps (except ANSTO) to the [Roadmap repository](https://github.com/mantidproject/roadmap)
- Make CSNS (and whole group) aware of Mantid Imaging.

# Initially Proposed Agenda
 
- Welcome Anna as the new SWG Chair
- Spend ~10 mins on each roadmap and identify commonalities.
